Problem : Excuting submit when I press Enter key at form input tag even though I didn't bind event

Cause :  Hitting ENTER in a text input field in an HTML form has rather different effects on different browsers

Solution  : 
  $('form input').keydown(function (e) {
      if (e.keyCode == 13) {
          e.preventDefault();
          return false;
      }
  });


but I'm still curious Why Hitting ENTER doesn't excute submission at other jsp in same project
