<studying about cUrl command>
I wanted to know status of server in bash shell then I found cUrl command 

command line what I use is
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -i --user name:password --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getblockchaininfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' ${SERVER}

-s : silent mode, don't print out message and progress even if using -o option, It doesn't print remote data and result of /dev/null
-o : Usually curl print data from remote to console. When write file after -o It save data as the file you wrote(Useful for saving).
-w <format> : Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. 
-i : Include the HTTP response headers in the output. The HTTP response headers can include things like server name, cookies, date of the document, HTTP version and more...

--user :(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server
--data-binary <data> : (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing whatsoever

-H <header/@file> : (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server.
