1. open gitBash at your local project directory (or move to there in bash)
2. git remote add origin https://github.com/mindplace/test-repo.git
3. git push origin master
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/younahshin-dev/younahShop.git'

4. git pull origin master
From https://github.com/younahshin-dev/younahShop
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
