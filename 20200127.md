volatile

The core saves the value from memory to the cache,
retrieves the value from the cache first, and only retrieves the value from memory 
if there is no value in the cache
-> If it doesnâ€™t be refreshed the value might be different from memory

>>boolean suspended = false; -> volatile boolean suspended = false;
>>the core retrieves value from memory by using volatile

JVM processes data in 4byte -> int of type smaller than int can be processed by one command(minimum working position)
but long and double is 8byte size -> these can not be read and written by one command so the othe thread can break process while read or write.
solution : using synchronized or volatile
